        <div>DIV 1: this should get displayed on the first line</div>
        <div>DIV 2: this should get displayed on the next line cuz div is block level</div>
        <span>SPAN 1: this should get displayed on the next line cuz DIV 2 pushes it to stay on the above line alone</span>
        <div>DIV 3: this should get displayed on the next line cuz it wants to be on a new line
            <span>SPAN 2 (inside DIV 3): its inside DIV 3 so it can just go right after the DIV 3 contents in the same line</div></span>
